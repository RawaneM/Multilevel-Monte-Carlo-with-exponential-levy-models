# Multilevel-Monte-Carlo-with-exponentiel-levy-models
The main objective of our work is to replicate a very recent study conducted by Michael B. Giles and Yuan Xia (2017) which analyse the efficiency of a Multilevel Monte Carlo method on three types of exotic options, namely Asian, Lookback and Barrier options and three Lévy models, namely Variance Gamma (VG), Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) and negative α-stable processes. In the following work you will have a brief summary of the paper of Giles that served as main support for this project, we then suggest a critical analysis of the paper before proposing an extension by using the multilevel method with Exponential Lévy processes to analyse real life pricing problem.
